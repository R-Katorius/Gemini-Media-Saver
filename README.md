# Gemini Media Saver (SVG Edition)

[![Install](https://img.shields.io/badge/Install-Direct_Link-green?style=for-the-badge&logo=tampermonkey)](https://github.com/R-Katorius/Gemini-Media-Saver/raw/refs/heads/main/Gemini_Media_Saver.user.js)

A lightweight and efficient Tampermonkey userscript designed to enhance your Google Gemini experience by adding one-click save options for generated images and text responses.

## ✨ Features

-   **Smart File Organization:** Automatically saves all media and text into a dedicated `/Gemini` subfolder within your Downloads directory, keeping your workspace clean.
    
-   **One-Click Image Download:** Adds a "Save Photo" button to all images generated by Gemini.
    
-   **Text Export:** Adds a "Save Text" button to download chat responses as `.txt` files.
    
-   **Persistent State:** Uses `localStorage` to remember which items you've already saved, changing the button status to "Done" or "Saved" even after a page refresh.
    
-   **Native UI:** Styled with Google's design language (Google Sans, blur effects) for a seamless look.
    
-   **Precise Timestamps:** Automatically generates formatted timestamps for filenames to ensure easy sorting.
    

## 🚀 Installation

1.  Install a userscript manager like [Tampermonkey](https://www.tampermonkey.net/).
    
2.  **Note:** To allow the script to create the `/Gemini` folder, go to Tampermonkey **Settings**, set **Config Mode** to "Advanced", and change **Download Mode** to "Browser API".
    
3.  Create a new script in your manager.
    
4.  Copy and paste the code from `Gemini-Media-Saver.user.js` into the editor.
    
5.  Save and navigate to [Gemini](https://gemini.google.com/).
    

## 🛠 How It Works

The script monitors the Gemini chat interface using a `MutationObserver`. When a new response or image appears, it injects a stylized button:

-   **Images:** Saved via `GM_download` as `Gemini/gemini_photo_[timestamp].png`.
    
-   **Text:** Cleaned of UI buttons and saved as `Gemini/gemini_answer_[timestamp].txt`.
